        <h2>Description</h2>
        </p>
        <p>Bigoli is a usually fresh pasta, mostly eaten in Veneto. It‘s made with flour, eggs (often duck eggs), salt, water or milk and sometimes butter.It looks like very thick spaghetti and is about 3-4mm in diameter. Traditionally this pasta was made with a press called a torchio or bigolaro which had to be wound by hand as the pasta dough passed through the holes in the bottom.</p>
        <p>Bigoli is most often eaten with various fat-rich sauces, the most well-known bigoli recipe is duck ragu. In the past, the traditional recipe for this ragu involved cooking the pasta in a fatty broth in which a young duck had been boiled. The Venetians then made a sauce with flavored butter and the offal of the duck, which they ate with the bigoli. The duck itself was eaten after.</p>

            <li>Heat the oil in a heavy-duty pot or deep frying pan.</li>
            <li>Season the duck pieces with salt and pepper and place them skin side down in the pot.</li>
            <li>Sear until the skin is browned and crisp.</li>
            <li>Turn the pieces over and brown the other sides</li>
            <li>Remove the duck and pour off all but about 1 tablespoon of the rendered fat and discard</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium low and add the celery, onion, and carrot.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring frequently until the vegetables are softened.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute.</li>

            <li>Return the duck to the pot and bring the liquid to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low, just enough to maintain a gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and simmer until the meat is tender, approx 1.5 to 2 hours. Be careful not to let the duck dry out.</li>
            <li>If the sauce starts to dry out add more white wine or chicken broth.</li>
            <li>Remove the duck from the pot and set aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Skim the excess fat from the top of the sauce with a large spoon.</li>
            <li>If the sauce seems thin, continue simmering until thickened to desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Discard the duck skin and cut the meat off the leg bones.</li>
            <li>Shred or cut all the duck meat into very small pieces</li>
            <li>Add the meat to the sauce.</li>
            <li>Let the sauce simmer gently for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the bay leaf and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Cook the bigoli al dente according to the instructions on the packet if store bought. 6-8 minutes if homemade.</li>
            <li>Reserve about 1 cup of the cooking water and then drain the pasta.</li>
            <li>Return the pasta to the pot and toss it with some of the ragù, adding a little of the pasta cooking water if it seems dry.</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta with more ragù spooned over the top, sprinkled with the grated cheese.</li>
