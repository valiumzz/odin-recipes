        <h2>Description</h2>
        </p>
        <p id="description"><b>Bigoli is a usually fresh pasta, mostly eaten in Veneto. It‘s made with flour, eggs (often duck eggs), salt, water or milk and sometimes butter.It looks like very thick spaghetti and is about 3-4mm in diameter. Traditionally this pasta was made with a press called a torchio or bigolaro which had to be wound by hand as the pasta dough passed through the holes in the bottom.</b></p>
        <p id="description">Bigoli is most often eaten with various fat-rich sauces, the most well-known bigoli recipe is duck ragu. In the past, the traditional recipe for this ragu involved cooking the pasta in a fatty broth in which a young duck had been boiled. The Venetians then made a sauce with flavored butter and the offal of the duck, which they ate with the bigoli. The duck itself was eaten after.</p>
